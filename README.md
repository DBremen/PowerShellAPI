# Serverless PowerShell API

Create a serverless API in Azure. Learn to expose your PowerShell scripts as API endpoints!

Solutions used:

- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
    - And its "experimental" PowerShell language support for PS v4
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Swagger v2.0 API spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
- [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/)

Azure services do most of the heavy lifting, and the Azure Functions service supports multiple languages. If you bring your own language and replace part two of this series, the rest of the content is language-agnostic.
